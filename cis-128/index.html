    <p1>My name is Pritika Singh. At the moment, I am a stay at home mom to my toddler. I have prior experience working in special education, early childhood education, along with some retail and office positions. </p1>
    
    <p>I am taking this Web and Mobile Application Development course to gain skills and knowledge needed to enter the field of web development. I aspire to become a full stack web developer one day, but I am looking forward to stepping into this field as a front end developer first in order to gain some experience. </p>
